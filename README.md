## Welcome to Basic Chrome Extension

This is a basic setup to test and experience the functionality of a basic chrome extension referred in many tutorials.

### Setting up

Clone the Repo
```markdown
git clone https://github.com/udarafossdev/chrome-extension.git
```

### Installing the Extension to your chrome browser

- Navigate to the following URL in your chrome browser
```markdown
chrome://extensions
```
- Make sure that you tick `developer mode`

- Click `Load unpacked extension...`

- Browse to the downloaded directory

### Current Functionality

1. When you click the icon, there will be a popup created in HTML for you to meddle with.
2. If you observe the `manifest.json` closely, two JS files are developed to create basic JS alerts in URLs containing youtube.com and blogspot.com

_Happy Experimenting! Have fun!_

####Feel free to add some more awsome functionalities to the repo!
Make sure that you add them to the documentation too!
